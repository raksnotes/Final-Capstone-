## My Contribution 

We want to see the correlations between the dependent and independent variables. In order for that to be visualized, I proposed that I show a scatterplot matrix for different groups of independent variables vs. the dependent variable "Deaths" to see how they correlate, to test the normality and significance using my knowledge in R. 

So far, I've created a scatterplot matrix for 1 group of data that felt would best fit a certain category which equated to Deaths Vs. Vulnerable Populations. In the R script it will show the list of independent variables that I grouped together into the Vulnerable Populations, which are also the x values, while the y value is Deaths. 

The second scatterplot I will be doing is Deaths Vs. Race/Ethnicity, and the third scatterplot is going to be Deaths Vs. Number of Risk Factors. 

Altogether, in regard to our research question for testing overall significance of the data, I will be using the lm() function to create a full model, that would list
all the significance of each independent variable, and potentially create a reduced model to narrow down the most significant variable in this model.
