## My Contribution 

We want to see the correlations between the dependent and independent variables. In order for that to be visualized, I proposed that I show a scatterplot matrix for different groups of independent variables vs. the dependent variable "Deaths" to see how they correlate, to test the normality and significance using my knowledge in R. 

So far, I've created a scatterplot matrix for 1 group of data that felt would best fit a certain category which equated to Deaths Vs. Vulnerable Populations. In the R script it will show the list of independent variables that I grouped together into the Vulnerable Populations, which are also the x values, while the y value is Deaths.
