## My Contribution 

We want to see the correlations between the dependent and independent variables. In order for that to be visualized, I proposed that I show a scatterplot matrix for different groups of independent variables vs. the dependent variable "Deaths" to see how they correlate, to test the normality and significance using my knowledge in R.
