# PRESENTATION

## Selected Topic
The topic selected by this group is the US Census Bureau's "Community Resilience Estimates" model data for 2019, and its correlation with reported COVID-19 mortalities at the county level.  

The stated purpose of the Community Resilience Estimates model (hereafter known as the CRE) is to evaluate "the capacity of individuals and households within a community to absorb the external stresses of a disaster"[^1] such as an extreme weather event or, more relevantly to this group's selected topic, a viral pandemic.  The data used to generate these estimates were gathered from the American Community Survey and the Census Planning Database, selected for their salience for matters of social equity.

The 2019 CRE dataset was selected specifically because it represented an opportunity to directly evaluate the predictive power of a national social scientific project in light of a national disaster event occuring shortly after the data was gathered and the model compiled.  Such an evaluation, which poses real potential for producing novel insights into the empirical validity of a high-profile and publicly-funded study like the CRE, represents a worthwhile project and an excellent exercise in data analytics.
